# Verify and finalize a milestone

Verification asks whether the intended outcome works, not whether the task list was checked off.

## Verify in layers

1. Call `sdd(operation="status")` and `sdd(operation="validate", payload={"record":false})`.
2. Inspect the actual diff and implementation. Confirm no task summary claims work outside the changed code.
3. Map linked requirements and milestone exit criteria to concrete evidence.
4. Run the smallest trustworthy test set first, then broader checks proportional to blast radius:
   - formatting, linting, type checks;
   - unit and integration tests;
   - build/package/startup checks;
   - migrations and rollback behavior;
   - security, concurrency, performance, or failure-path tests where relevant;
   - user-visible/manual verification for interfaces that automated tests do not cover.
5. For a high-risk milestone, use an independent reviewer or fresh-context verifier. Give it the implementation, requirements, and evidence—not the original planner's reasoning.
6. Fix failures as implementation work. Add or reopen tasks when a repair is substantial; do not hide it in the verification narrative.

## Record missing evidence

```json
{"operation":"record_evidence","root":"<repo>","target":"M001-T002","payload":{"type":"integration_test","command":"pnpm test:integration","result":"passed","artifact":"artifacts/integration.xml","requirement_ids":["REQ-002"]}}
```

Evidence is concise metadata; large logs belong in project artifacts or CI.

## Final checks

Do not finalize while:

- any task remains pending, in progress, or blocked;
- validation has an error;
- a must-have requirement lacks observable proof;
- critical behavior relies only on a mocked path;
- a known regression or security issue is deferred without explicit acceptance.

Warnings may remain when they are understood and proportionate. Record material residual risk as an ADR, issue, or future milestone rather than expanding the current milestone indefinitely.

## Finalize

```json
{"operation":"finalize_milestone","root":"<repo>","target":"M001","payload":{"summary":"What shipped, how it was verified, and remaining known limitations."}}
```

The plugin marks the milestone verified, advances to the next planned milestone, or completes the project when none remain.

## Output

Report delivered outcomes, exact verification evidence, unresolved risks, health score, and next milestone. Avoid a process diary.
